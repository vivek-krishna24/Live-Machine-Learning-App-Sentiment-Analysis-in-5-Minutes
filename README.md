# 🌍 Live Machine Learning App — Sentiment Analysis in 5 Minutes

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a **live, shareable Machine Learning app** in just **5 minutes** using **Gradio** and **Hugging Face Transformers**.  
The app performs **sentiment analysis** — it takes any sentence and predicts whether the sentiment is **POSITIVE** or **NEGATIVE**.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How to build a **real-time ML web app** without any web development.
- How to use **Hugging Face Transformers** to load a pre-trained NLP model.
- How to deploy the app **instantly with Gradio** — locally or online.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Step 1 — Install Dependencies

You only need two libraries:  
- `gradio` → for building the interactive app  
- `transformers` → for using pre-trained NLP models  

Run these commands in your terminal or notebook:

```bash
pip install gradio
pip install transformers


**Step 2 — Write the Code**
